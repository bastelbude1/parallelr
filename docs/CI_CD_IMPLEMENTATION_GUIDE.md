## What is CI/CD?

### Continuous Integration (CI)

**Definition**: The practice of automatically testing every code change as soon as it's pushed to the repository.

**Purpose**:
- Catch bugs early, before they reach production
- Ensure new code doesn't break existing functionality
- Validate code quality and style
- Provide fast feedback to developers

**How it works**:
```
Developer pushes code → CI system runs tests → Pass/Fail notification
```

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

**Definition**: The automated process of deploying tested code to production environments.

**Purpose**:
- Reduce manual deployment errors
- Enable rapid releases
- Ensure consistent deployment process
- Automate release workflow

**In Our Case**: We implement CI (testing) with the groundwork for CD when needed.

## GitHub Actions Overview

### What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD platform** integrated directly into GitHub that allows you to automate your software development workflows.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. **Workflow**
- A configurable automated process
- Defined in YAML files under `.github/workflows/`
- Triggered by events (push, pull request, schedule, etc.)

#### 2. **Job**
- A set of steps that execute on the same runner
- Jobs run in parallel by default
- Can be made dependent on other jobs

#### 3. **Step**
- An individual task within a job
- Can run commands or use actions
- Executes sequentially within a job

#### 4. **Runner**
- A server that runs your workflows
- GitHub provides hosted runners (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- You can also host your own

#### 5. **Action**
- A reusable unit of code
- Can be used across workflows
- Available from GitHub Marketplace

### Visual Workflow Structure

## Our Implementation

### File Location

```
.github/workflows/test.yml
```

### What Our CI/CD Does

1. **Automated Testing** - Runs 109 tests on every push/PR
2. **Multi-Version Testing** - Tests against Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
3. **Code Quality** - Runs linters (pylint, flake8)
4. **Coverage Reporting** - Generates and uploads code coverage
5. **Legacy Support** - Validates backward compatibility
6. **Status Reporting** - Summarizes all test results

### Triggers

Our CI runs on:
- **Push** to `master` branch
- **Push** to any `feature/**` branch
- **Pull requests** targeting `master`

---

## Step-by-Step Component Breakdown

### 1. Workflow Name and Triggers

```yaml
name: Test Suite

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, feature/** ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
```

**Explanation**:
- `name`: Human-readable name shown in GitHub UI
- `on`: Defines when the workflow runs
  - `push.branches`: Triggers on pushes to master or any feature branch
  - `pull_request.branches`: Triggers when PR targets master

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents CI from running on every branch (saves resources)
- Ensures all PRs are tested before merge
- Feature branches get tested during development

---

### 2. Main Test Job with Matrix Strategy

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    name: Run Tests (Python ${{ matrix.python-version }})
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11', '3.12']
```

**Explanation**:
- `jobs`: Container for all jobs in the workflow
- `test`: Job ID (unique identifier)
- `name`: Display name with dynamic Python version
- `runs-on`: Specifies the runner OS (Ubuntu Linux)
- `strategy.matrix`: Creates multiple job instances
  - One for each Python version
  - Jobs run in parallel
- `fail-fast: false`: Continue testing other versions even if one fails

**Why This Matters**:
- Tests compatibility across Python versions simultaneously
- Catches version-specific bugs early
- Saves time with parallel execution

**Matrix Build Benefits**:
```
Traditional Sequential:
Test 3.8 (2 min) → Test 3.9 (2 min) → Test 3.10 (2 min) → Test 3.11 (2 min) → Test 3.12 (2 min)
Total: 10 minutes

Matrix Parallel:
Test 3.8 (2 min) ┐
Test 3.9 (2 min) ├─ All run simultaneously
Test 3.10 (2 min)├─ on separate runners
Test 3.11 (2 min)├─
Test 3.12 (2 min)┘
Total: 2 minutes
```

---

### 3. Checkout Code Step

```yaml
steps:
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

**Explanation**:
- `steps`: List of sequential tasks in the job
- `uses`: Uses a pre-built action from GitHub Marketplace
- `actions/checkout@v4`: Official GitHub action to clone your repository

**What It Does**:
1. Clones your repository to the runner
2. Checks out the branch/commit that triggered the workflow
3. Makes your code available to subsequent steps

**Why This Matters**:
- First step in almost every workflow
- Without it, the runner has no access to your code
- `@v4` ensures you use the latest stable version

---

### 4. Setup Python Step

```yaml
- name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
  uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
```

**Explanation**:
- `uses: actions/setup-python@v5`: Official action for Python setup
- `with`: Parameters passed to the action
- `${{ matrix.python-version }}`: Variable from matrix strategy

**What It Does**:
1. Installs the specified Python version
2. Adds Python and pip to PATH
3. Caches pip dependencies for faster subsequent runs

**Why This Matters**:
- Ensures consistent Python environment
- Matrix variable makes this work for all versions
- Caching speeds up workflow by 30-50%

---

### 5. Install Dependencies Step

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r tests/requirements-test.txt
    # Install optional dependencies for full functionality
    pip install pyyaml psutil || true
```

**Explanation**:
- `run`: Executes shell commands
- `|`: YAML multiline string indicator
- `|| true`: Continue even if command fails (for optional deps)

**What It Does**:
1. Updates pip to latest version
2. Installs test dependencies from requirements file
3. Attempts to install optional dependencies

**Why This Matters**:
- Test dependencies may differ from runtime dependencies
- Optional deps don't fail the build if unavailable
- Fresh pip prevents compatibility issues

---

### 6. Run Tests Steps

```yaml
- name: Run unit tests
  run: |
    pytest tests/unit/ -v --tb=short

- name: Run integration tests
  run: |
    pytest tests/integration/ -v --tb=short

- name: Run security tests
  run: |
    pytest tests/security/ -v --tb=short
```

**Explanation**:
- `pytest`: Test framework command
- `tests/unit/`: Directory to test
- `-v`: Verbose output (shows each test name)
- `--tb=short`: Short traceback format for failures

**Why Separate Steps**:
- If unit tests fail, you still see integration test results
- Easier to identify which category failed
- GitHub UI shows each step separately for clarity

**Test Output Example**:
```
tests/unit/test_placeholders.py::test_replace_single PASSED [ 10%]
tests/unit/test_placeholders.py::test_replace_indexed PASSED [ 20%]
...
===== 42 passed in 1.23s =====
```

---

### 7. Coverage Reporting Step

```yaml
- name: Run all tests with coverage
  run: |
    pip install pytest-cov
    pytest tests/ --cov=bin/parallelr.py --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term-missing
```

**Explanation**:
- `pytest-cov`: Plugin for coverage measurement
- `--cov=bin/parallelr.py`: File/directory to measure
- `--cov-report=xml`: Generate XML for Codecov
- `--cov-report=term-missing`: Show uncovered lines in terminal

**What Coverage Measures**:
- Which lines of code were executed during tests
- Identifies untested code paths
- Reports percentage coverage

**Coverage Report Example**:
```
Name                 Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
--------------------------------------------------
bin/parallelr.py      1234     56   95%   45-47, 123-125
--------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                 1234     56   95%
```

---

### 8. Upload Coverage to Codecov

```yaml
- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
  if: matrix.python-version == '3.11'
  with:
    file: ./coverage.xml
    fail_ci_if_error: false
    token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
```

**Explanation**:
- `uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4`: Third-party action
- `if`: Conditional execution (only for Python 3.11)
- `secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN`: Encrypted secret stored in GitHub
- `fail_ci_if_error: false`: Don't fail build if upload fails

**Why Only Python 3.11**:
- Avoids uploading same coverage 5 times
- Codecov combines data if needed
- Saves API calls and time

**Setting Up Codecov**:
1. Sign up at codecov.io with GitHub account
2. Enable repository
3. Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` to GitHub repository secrets
4. Badge shows coverage percentage in README

---

### 9. Lint Job

```yaml
lint:
  name: Lint Code
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Set up Python
    uses: actions/setup-python@v5
    with:
      python-version: '3.11'

  - name: Install linting tools
    run: |
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install pylint flake8

  - name: Run pylint
    run: |
      pylint bin/parallelr.py --disable=C0103,C0114,C0115,C0116 || true

  - name: Run flake8
    run: |
      flake8 bin/parallelr.py --max-line-length=120 --ignore=E501,W503 || true
```

**Explanation**:
- Separate job runs independently of test job
- `pylint`: Checks code quality, style, potential bugs
- `flake8`: Enforces PEP 8 style guide
- `|| true`: Don't fail build on linting issues (warnings only)
- `--disable`: Ignores specific rules

**Why Linting**:
- Enforces consistent code style
- Catches potential bugs (unused variables, etc.)
- Improves code readability
- Runs fast (~10 seconds)

**Common Lint Rules**:
- `C0103`: Invalid name (enforces naming conventions)
- `C0114`: Missing module docstring
- `E501`: Line too long (>79 chars)
- `W503`: Line break before binary operator

---

### 10. Legacy Test Job

```yaml
test-legacy:
  name: Run Legacy Bash Tests
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Set up Python
    uses: actions/setup-python@v5
    with:
      python-version: '3.11'

  - name: Install dependencies
    run: |
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install pyyaml psutil || true

  - name: Run multi-argument tests
    run: |
      cd test_cases/arguments_mode
      bash test_multi_args_suite.sh

  - name: Run backward compatibility tests
    run: |
      cd test_cases/arguments_mode
      bash run_tests.sh
```

**Explanation**:
- Tests existing bash-based test suite
- Ensures backward compatibility
- Validates old tests still pass alongside new pytest tests

**Why Keep Legacy Tests**:
- Proven test cases from production use
- Migration safety net
- Different testing approach (bash scripts vs pytest)

---

### 11. Summary Job

```yaml
summary:
  name: Test Summary
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [test, lint, test-legacy]
  if: always()

  steps:
  - name: Check test results
    run: |
      echo "Test job status: ${{ needs.test.result }}"
      echo "Lint job status: ${{ needs.lint.result }}"
      echo "Legacy test job status: ${{ needs.test-legacy.result }}"

      if [ "${{ needs.test.result }}" != "success" ]; then
        echo "❌ Tests failed"
        exit 1
      fi

      if [ "${{ needs.test-legacy.result }}" != "success" ]; then
        echo "❌ Legacy tests failed"
        exit 1
      fi

      echo "✅ All tests passed!"
```

**Explanation**:
- `needs`: Waits for specified jobs to complete
- `if: always()`: Runs even if previous jobs failed
- `needs.test.result`: Access result of test job
- `exit 1`: Fails the job if tests failed

**Why Summary Job**:
- Single place to see overall status
- Helpful for branch protection rules
- Can send notifications
- Provides clear pass/fail status

**Job Dependencies Visualization**:
```
test (3.8) ────┐
test (3.9) ────┤
test (3.10)────├─► summary ──► Pass/Fail
test (3.11)────├─► (waits for all)
test (3.12)────┤
lint ──────────┤
test-legacy ───┘
```

## Configuration Files

### 1. pytest.ini

**Location**: Repository root

**Purpose**: Configure pytest behavior across all test runs (local and CI)

```ini
[pytest]
# Test discovery patterns
python_files = test_*.py        # Find files named test_*.py
python_classes = Test*          # Find classes named Test*
python_functions = test_*       # Find functions named test_*

# Directories to search for tests
testpaths = tests

# Minimum version
minversion = 7.0

# Output options
addopts =
    -ra                         # Show all test outcomes
    --strict-markers            # Error on unknown markers
    --strict-config             # Error on config issues
    --showlocals                # Show local variables in failures
    --tb=short                  # Short traceback format

# Console output styling
console_output_style = progress  # Progress bar

# Coverage options (when using --cov)
[coverage:run]
source = bin                    # Measure coverage for bin/ directory
omit =
    */tests/*                   # Exclude tests from coverage
    */lib/*                     # Exclude libraries

[coverage:report]
precision = 2                   # Show coverage to 2 decimal places
show_missing = True             # Show line numbers of missed code
skip_covered = False            # Don't skip fully covered files

# Test markers
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    integration: integration tests
    security: security tests
    performance: performance tests
    smoke: quick smoke tests for basic validation
    unit: unit tests
```

**Key Benefits**:
- Consistent test behavior everywhere
- Centralized configuration
- Prevents common mistakes (strict modes)
- Custom markers for test organization

**Using Markers**:
```bash
# Run only unit tests
pytest -m unit

# Skip slow tests
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run security and integration tests
pytest -m "security or integration"
```

---

### 2. requirements-test.txt

**Location**: `tests/requirements-test.txt`

**Purpose**: Isolate test dependencies from runtime dependencies

```python
# Core testing framework
pytest>=7.0.0,<8.0.0
pytest-cov>=4.0.0,<5.0.0           # Coverage reporting
pytest-timeout>=2.1.0,<3.0.0       # Test timeouts
pytest-xdist>=3.0.0,<4.0.0         # Parallel test execution
pytest-mock>=3.10.0,<4.0.0         # Mocking support

# Additional testing tools
pytest-html>=3.1.0,<4.0.0          # HTML test reports
pytest-json-report>=1.5.0,<2.0.0   # JSON test reports

# Code quality
pylint>=2.15.0,<3.0.0              # Linting
black>=22.0.0,<23.0.0              # Code formatting
mypy>=0.990,<1.0.0                 # Type checking

# Performance testing
pytest-benchmark>=4.0.0,<5.0.0     # Performance benchmarks
memory-profiler>=0.60.0,<1.0.0     # Memory profiling

# Security testing
safety>=2.3.0,<3.0.0               # Dependency vulnerability scanner

# Utilities
psutil>=5.9.0                      # Process monitoring
pyyaml>=6.0                        # YAML support
```

**Why Separate File**:
- Development dependencies don't bloat production installs
- Clear distinction between runtime and test needs
- Version pinning prevents test breakage
- CI installs only what's needed

## How to Replicate for Your Project

### Step 1: Create Test Suite

```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,security}
touch tests/__init__.py
touch tests/unit/__init__.py
touch tests/integration/__init__.py
touch tests/security/__init__.py

# Create requirements file
cat > tests/requirements-test.txt << 'EOF'
pytest>=7.0.0,<8.0.0
pytest-cov>=4.0.0,<5.0.0
pytest-timeout>=2.1.0,<3.0.0
EOF

# Create pytest config
cat > pytest.ini << 'EOF'
[pytest]
python_files = test_*.py
python_classes = Test*
python_functions = test_*
testpaths = tests
minversion = 7.0
addopts = -ra --strict-markers --tb=short
EOF
```

### Step 2: Write Your First Test

```python
# tests/unit/test_example.py
def test_addition():
    """Basic test example."""
    assert 1 + 1 == 2

def test_subtraction():
    """Another test example."""
    assert 5 - 3 == 2
```

### Step 3: Test Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r tests/requirements-test.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=your_module --cov-report=html
```

### Step 4: Create GitHub Actions Workflow

```bash
# Create directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Create workflow file
cat > .github/workflows/test.yml << 'EOF'
name: Test Suite

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Run Tests (Python ${{ matrix.python-version }})
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11', '3.12']

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r tests/requirements-test.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

    - name: Run tests with coverage
      run: |
        pip install pytest-cov
        pytest tests/ --cov=your_module --cov-report=xml

    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
      if: matrix.python-version == '3.11'
      with:
        file: ./coverage.xml
        fail_ci_if_error: false
EOF
```

### Step 5: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .github/workflows/test.yml pytest.ini tests/
git commit -m "ci: Add GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin your-branch
```

### Step 6: Verify in GitHub

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. See your workflow running
4. Check test results

---

## Advanced Features

### 1. Code Coverage Badges

Add to your README.md:

```markdown
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/username/repo/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/username/repo)
```

**Setup**:
1. Sign up at https://codecov.io
2. Connect GitHub account
3. Enable your repository
4. Copy badge URL from settings

### 2. Status Badges

```markdown
[![Tests](https://github.com/username/repo/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/username/repo/actions/workflows/test.yml)
```

### 3. Schedule-Based Testing

Test nightly or weekly:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # 2 AM UTC daily
```

**Cron Examples**:
- `'0 2 * * *'` - Daily at 2 AM
- `'0 2 * * 0'` - Weekly on Sunday at 2 AM
- `'0 0 1 * *'` - Monthly on 1st at midnight

### 4. Conditional Steps

```yaml
- name: Deploy to staging
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
  run: ./deploy-staging.sh

- name: Deploy to production
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: ./deploy-prod.sh
```

### 5. Caching Dependencies

Speed up workflows:

```yaml
- name: Cache pip dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements-test.txt') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces workflow time by 30-50%
- Saves network bandwidth
- Consistent dependency versions

### 6. Artifacts

Save test results:

```yaml
- name: Upload test results
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-results
    path: test-results/
    retention-days: 30
```

### 7. Notifications

Slack notification on failure:

```yaml
- name: Notify Slack
  if: failure()
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1
  with:
    webhook-url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

### 8. Matrix Strategy Advanced

Test multiple dimensions:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11', '3.12']
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    include:
      - python-version: '3.12'
        os: ubuntu-latest
        experimental: true
```

This creates 15 job combinations (5 Python × 3 OS).

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Tests Pass Locally But Fail in CI

**Causes**:
- Environment differences
- Missing dependencies
- Hardcoded paths
- Timezone/locale differences

**Solutions**:
```yaml
# Add debugging
- name: Debug environment
  run: |
    python --version
    pip list
    pwd
    ls -la
```

### Issue 2: Workflow Doesn't Trigger

**Check**:
1. YAML syntax is valid (use YAML linter)
2. Branch names match trigger patterns
3. Workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
4. File has `.yml` or `.yaml` extension

**Validate YAML**:
```bash
# Install yamllint
pip install yamllint

# Check syntax
yamllint .github/workflows/test.yml
```

### Issue 3: Secrets Not Working

**Common Mistakes**:
- Typo in secret name
- Secret not defined in repository settings
- Using secret in forked repository (security restriction)

**Check**:
1. Go to Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Verify secret name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Secrets are not accessible in PR from forks

### Issue 4: Job Times Out

**Default Timeout**: 360 minutes (6 hours)

**Set Custom Timeout**:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 30  # Fail if job runs longer than 30 min
```

### Issue 5: Coverage Not Uploading

**Check**:
1. Codecov token is set correctly
2. coverage.xml file is generated
3. File path in action matches actual path

**Debug**:
```yaml
- name: Check coverage file
  run: |

### Issue 6: Matrix Job Failing for One Version

**Use Conditional Logic**:
```yaml
- name: Run Python 3.8 specific tests
  if: matrix.python-version == '3.8'
  run: pytest tests/legacy/
```

### Issue 7: Workflow Too Slow

**Optimization Strategies**:
1. Enable caching (pip, dependencies)
2. Run jobs in parallel
3. Skip unnecessary steps
4. Use faster runners (self-hosted)
5. Reduce test scope for CI (full suite nightly)

**Example Optimization**:
```yaml
# Fast CI for quick feedback
on:
  pull_request:
    jobs:
      smoke-test:
        run: pytest -m smoke

# Full CI nightly
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'
    jobs:
      full-test:
        run: pytest tests/
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Workflows Fast

**Goal**: < 5 minutes for CI feedback

**Strategies**:
- Run slow tests nightly, not on every push
- Use test markers (`-m "not slow"`)
- Parallel execution with `pytest-xdist`
- Cache dependencies

### 2. Fail Fast for Quick Feedback

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: true  # Stop all jobs if one fails
```

**Use Cases**:
- `fail-fast: true` - Stop immediately (saves resources)
- `fail-fast: false` - See all results (our choice for multi-version testing)

### 3. Use Specific Action Versions

```yaml
# Good: Pinned version
uses: actions/checkout@v4

# Bad: Latest tag (can break)
uses: actions/checkout@latest

# Acceptable: Major version
uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### 4. Secure Secrets Management

**Never**:
```yaml
# ❌ Don't hardcode secrets
run: curl -u user:password123 api.example.com
```

**Always**:
```yaml
# ✅ Use GitHub Secrets
run: curl -u user:${{ secrets.API_PASSWORD }} api.example.com
```

### 5. Descriptive Job and Step Names

```yaml
# ❌ Bad
- name: Run tests
  run: pytest

# ✅ Good
- name: Run unit tests for authentication module
  run: pytest tests/unit/test_auth.py -v
```

### 6. Test in Similar Environment to Production

If production uses Python 3.10 on Ubuntu, prioritize that in CI:

```yaml
matrix:
  python-version: ['3.10']  # Primary
  include:
    - python-version: '3.8'  # Compatibility
    - python-version: '3.12'  # Future-proofing
```

### 7. Branch Protection Rules

**GitHub Settings → Branches → Add rule**:
- Require status checks before merging
- Require branches to be up to date
- Include administrators

**Example**:
```
Required checks:
- Test (Python 3.8)
- Test (Python 3.9)
- Test (Python 3.10)
- Test (Python 3.11)
- Test (Python 3.12)
- Lint
- Test Summary
```

### 8. Document CI Failures

Add to repository docs:

```markdown
## CI Failures

### Common Causes
1. Dependency conflict: Check requirements-test.txt
2. New Python version: Update .github/workflows/test.yml
3. Test timeout: Increase timeout or optimize test
```

### 9. Version Your Workflows

```yaml
# Add version comment
name: Test Suite v2.0

# Or use workflow versioning
# .github/workflows/test-v2.yml
```

### 10. Monitor CI Usage

**GitHub provides**:
- 2,000 free minutes/month for private repos
- Unlimited for public repos
- Usage dashboard in Settings → Billing

**Optimize**:
- Reduce matrix dimensions
- Skip redundant jobs
- Use conditional execution

## Template for Quick Start

Save as `.github/workflows/python-test.yml`:

```yaml
name: Python Test Suite

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Test (Python ${{ matrix.python-version }})
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11']

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements-test.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest tests/ -v

    - name: Upload coverage
      if: matrix.python-version == '3.11'
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
      with:
        file: ./coverage.xml
```
